# 101

I found myself copying these files over every time I create a new project.
This is a collections of files I need with some defaults that work for me.

## usage

with `start` function in my [`.functions`](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles/blob/master/.functions#L13)

```sh
$ start <DEST>
```

or without

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/armno/101.git <DEST> && cd <DEST> && rm -rf .git
```
