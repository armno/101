# 101

I found myself copying these files over every time I create a new project.
This is a collections of files I need with some defaults.

## usage

```sh
$ cp -R ~/code/101 <DEST>
```

### todo

- [ ] this should ignore `.git` inside of `101` directory to be copied.
- [ ] automate: make this a `npm` command or yeoman generator.
